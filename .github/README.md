<h1 id="Dependencies">Dependencies And Programs</h1>
Be sure to read both mandatory programs thoroughly.

<h2 id="Mandatory">Mandatory Programs</h2>
<details>
  <summary>Stow</summary>
  As GNU says: "It is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct sets of software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them all appear to be installed in a single directory tree."<br>
  <br>
  In regards to it's working... In short, Stow takes directories inside your <strong>repo</strong> and pretends them to be the <strong>parent directory</strong> creating symbolic links in the <strong>parent directory itself.</strong><br>
  <br>
  Deeply explaning, if you are at <code>/home/[UserName]/.dotfiles</code> when using <code>stow .configurations</code> in your terminal, the configurations folder will take everything inside it and create <strong>symlinks</strong> in the home folder. It's as the <code>.configurations</code> <strong>directory</strong> would be now the <code>home</code> <strong>directory</strong> and the <code>.config</code> inside will be redirected to there.<br>
  <br>          
  If that didn't do it, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xMTKml9O0">chris@machine video and the pinned comment</a> will help ya understand it better since it's a little bit hard at first!

<details>
  <summary>Git</summary>
  As in Git: "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." <br>
  You'll need it to clone the repository using <code>git clone https://github.com/AtomicFeasT/.dotfiles.git</code>.

Install IceWM using `yay -s icewm`. <br> 
The `IceWM` option does not work with the startup option so prefer to use the `IceWM Session` instead. <br>
To access it, in the logging screen, below the password input click in the current option and select `IceWM Session`.

- To make your network module work and set the correct system variables for your system press `Ctrl + H` in the `HOME` folder to show your dotfiles and go to `~/.config/bspwm/polybar/system`, read all instructions inside the file, then fill all the four variables with your specific results.

- If you're not fond of some polybar modules go to `.config/bspwm/polybar/config` and remove modules from `modules-left, modules-right and modules-center` and then press `Ctrl+Shift+r` to reload the polybar.

  <li>Thanks for users in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">Unix Porn</a> for inspiring me, opening the doors to dotfiles and many other linux advantages relating to productivity and aesthetics. Tho my system don't have so much "personality" since i'm using many of Adi1090x ideas and files i'll get there, eventually, for now this is what i'm happy with!</li>
