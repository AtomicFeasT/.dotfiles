If you're lost this file is for you!

Thunar will open alongside this text file and there is a reason for that.
I'll teach you some essential keybindings to navigate through the system.
For better understanding go to ~/.icewm/keys and see all possible keybindings there.

Super+c - Opens Rofi to search for all your apps.
Super+x - Opens the powermenu so you can Shutdown, Restart, Logout and others...
Super+Enter - Opens Alacritty
Super+Shift+f - Opens thunar file explorer. 
Ctrl+Alt+b - Opens a tab in your default browser with duckduckgo.
Super+Shift+r - Restarts IceWM.

That's all! Hope you have a great day.

PS: If you want to prevent this file from starting go to ~/.icewm/startup and remove the line that contains "Introduction.txt".
